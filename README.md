## Generate the application


## Decisions made :
```dockerfile

1.Framework - We will use Spring Boot 3, as it provides a robust and efficient framework for building microservices.
2.Precompiler - We will not use any precompilers.
3.Project architecture - We will follow a layered architecture, with a controller layer for handling requests, a service layer for business logic, and a data access layer for accessing the CSV file.

Instructions to run the code:

1. Clone the Git repository: git clone https://github.com/Anas2024/chatgpt.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd chatgpt
3. You will need to create an account with ChatGPT (you can use your gmail account)
	Url: https://beta.openai.com/
	After you signup and sign in create an API key that you will use to communicate with the AIâ€™s
	API endpoint (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

4. go to application.properties and modify the property 'apiKey' and enter your key (example: apiKey=yourApiKey)
5. Build the Docker image: docker build -t chatgpt .
6. Run the Docker container: docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/home/app/file.csv -p 8080:8080 -it chatgpt:latest Note: if you want to replace "/home/app/file.csv" with the path to the folder where you want to store the CSV file on your host machine.
7. Access the Swagger UI by navigating to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
8. Send a POST request to the /chatgpt endpoint with the following JSON payload: { "question": "What is gluten sensitivity?" }
   The response will contain the answer provided by ChatGPT.
9. If you want to test the application on IDE intellej or eclipse you can remove the block in comment in the main of the class IzicapChatGptProject1Application.java

Notes:

We have used the OpenAI Java SDK to interact with the ChatGPT API.
We have used the Apache Commons CSV library to write to the CSV file.
We have provided a Dockerfile for building the Docker image.
We have provided unit and integration tests for the microservice.
```

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
#
# Build stage
#
FROM maven:3.6-openjdk-17-slim AS build
COPY src /home/app/src
COPY pom.xml /home/app
RUN mvn -f /home/app/pom.xml clean package

#
# Package stage
#
FROM openjdk:11-ea-17-jre-slim
COPY --from=build /home/app/target/chatgpt-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /usr/local/lib/chatgpt.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/usr/local/lib/chatgpt.jar"]

```
Note

This example uses a multi-stage build. The first stage is used to build the code. The second stage only contains the built jar and a JRE to run it (note how jar is copied between stages).

## Build the image

```sh
docker build -t chatgpt .
```

## Run the image
```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/home/app/file.csv -p 8080:8080 -it chatgpt:latest
```
## Unit Tests
```sh
To execute tests, simply go to src/test/java in the project and run as Junit test the class QuestionAnswerControllerTest.java
```

## Actuator
```sh
Actuator run on port 9000, to acces to actuator endpoints use http://localhost:9000/actuator
Example:  http://localhost:9000/actuator/health
```
